    <p align="left" id="Audi">Audi AG (German: [ˈaʊ̯di ʔaːˈɡeː] (listen)) is a German automotive manufacturer of luxury
        vehicles
        headquartered in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany. As a subsidiary of its parent company, the Volkswagen Group, Audi
        produces vehicles in nine production facilities worldwide.

        The origins of the company are complex, going back to the early 20th century and the initial enterprises (Horch
        and the Audiwerke) founded by engineer August Horch (1868–1951); and two other manufacturers (DKW and Wanderer),
        leading to the foundation of Auto Union in 1932. The modern Audi era began in the 1960s, when Auto Union was
        acquired by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz.[9] After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the
        Audi F103 series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969, thus creating the present-day form
        of the company.
